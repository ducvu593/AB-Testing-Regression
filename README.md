### Running the Code in Jupyter Notebook 

1. Download Jupyter Notebook for example through [Anaconda-Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/).
2. Open Jupyter Notebook either through the Anaconda-Navigator App or type "jupyter notebook" in the command line (this will open in a browser).
3. Select directory that contains the Jupyter Notebook file (extension ipynb) and the CSV files. Make sure both CSV files are in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Run the code from the toolbar.
